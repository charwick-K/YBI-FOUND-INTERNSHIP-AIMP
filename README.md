## ⚙️ How to Run These Projects

### 🔁 Option 1: Run with **Google Colab**
> _No installation required – just a browser!_

1. **Open Google Colab**: [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Click **File > Open Notebook**, then select the **GitHub tab**.
3. Paste the project’s notebook GitHub URL (if available) or upload the `.ipynb` file manually.
4. To mount a dataset:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   ```
   or read directly from the GitHub CSV URL using pandas:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   url = 'https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/Bank%20Churn%20Modelling.csv'
   data = pd.read_csv(url)
   ```
5. Execute cells one-by-one using `Shift + Enter`.
